The three of them gave us a follow up assignment to get people in Almere Haven involved. The inhabitants and other organisations, such as residents' committees, a 'white' club, the neighborhood workers from Amsterdam Saoel and Jelke, who had trained people there. A couple of important people are Hassan and his family. They got lots of friends and family involved, about 50 all together. And there are new key people in another neighborhood in Almere, who we also see as leaders. There is De Schor, a youth and welfare organisation. In general there is a lot of interest from these three organisations and participation as well, mostly from the municipality. But the welfare organisations say they are interested but they don't participate. We had lots of contact with the mosque, but in the end they don't participate. Um, yea

</p><p><strong>V14:</strong> oh wow
