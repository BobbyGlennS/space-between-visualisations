V11: Yes and that conflict was a result of a big conflict there. So really we should make more conflicts!

The three of them gave us a follow up assignment to get people in Almere Haven involved. The inhabitants and other organisations, such as residents’ committees, a ‘white’ club, the neighborhood workers from Amsterdam Saoel and Jelke, who had trained people there. A couple of important people are Hassan and his family. They got lots of friends and family involved, about 50 all together. And there are new key people in another neighborhood in Almere, who we also see as leaders. There is De Schor, a youth and welfare organisation. In general there is a lot of interest from these three organisations and participation as well, mostly from the municipality. But the welfare organisations say they are interested but they don’t participate. We had lots of contact with the mosque, but in the end they don’t participate. Um, yea
V11: well Hassan is but... 
V12: yes we’ve had concrete leads
V11: young people
V14: oh yeah

They are – and that is good, we have been working on this there for two years, and now there is a new group of inhabitants who are enthusiastic and want to participate. They want to do the ‘train the trainer’ program. And this is typical for what happens. We recently composed a letter for Bob to send to these people,
V14: oh wow

14,05:12,3.3,6.3,"V14: And whose idea was that? 
V11: That was our idea. We were so angry that all these people are eager to participate, and now we’ve been waiting months for a green light. And we couldn’t tell them a thing. So now you do it, is what we thought. And so he did. And that’s so typical for the relationship: we are constantly directing them",3,3,4,6,7,6,,,
